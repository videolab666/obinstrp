# Pitel Instant Replay for OBS Studio

**Low-memory instant replay for live sports broadcasts.**

Pitel Instant Replay captures the last seconds of any camera into a **compressed**
in-memory buffer (hardware H.264 all-intra via NVENC / AMF / QSV, with an
x264 software fallback) instead of holding raw frames in RAM. A 15-second
1080p60 buffer uses on the order of **tens of megabytes instead of several
gigabytes**, so multi-camera replay setups run comfortably on ordinary
streaming PCs.

## Why

The popular raw-buffer replay plugins keep every frame uncompressed in memory
(~8 MB per 1080p frame). With several cameras and a long buffer that easily
reaches many gigabytes and pushes a PC to its limit mid-broadcast. Sports
Replay solves that by encoding the buffer with your GPU, keeping quality high
while cutting memory use by roughly **50–100×**.

## Features

- **Compressed replay buffer** — per-camera capture filter, buffer duration
  and quality configurable.
- **Auto-play on scene switch** — cut to the replay scene and it plays the
  last N seconds automatically.
- **Slow motion & reverse** — playback speed from 10% to 400%, hotkeys for
  speed presets and direction.
- **Configurable end action** — freeze on the last frame, **return to the
  previous scene**, **cut to the replay camera's scene**, or loop.
- **Sponsor bumpers** — optional intro and outro video clips played around
  the replay (e.g. a "REPLAY" sting with a sponsor).
- **Automatic save to disk** — every replay is saved as an `.mp4` (muxed
  from the already-encoded frames, no re-encode).
- **Replay bin dock** — a dockable panel shows the last replays as
  thumbnails; **double-click sends a saved replay to program** and returns
  to the previous scene when it ends. Perfect for re-showing a play minutes
  later.
- **Multi-camera** — one capture filter per camera; replay any of them.

## Requirements

- OBS Studio 31+ (developed and tested on 32.0.2, Windows).
- A GPU with a hardware H.264 encoder recommended (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel); falls
  back to x264 software encoding otherwise.

## Installation

For the stable RAM-replay version, download and run the installer from the
[latest release](../../releases/latest).

The vMix-style disk/Event operator is currently developed on
`feature/disk-replay-core`. Open the latest successful workflow run for
[pull request #1](../../pull/1/checks), download the Windows x64 artifact,
unpack its inner `sports-replay-*-windows-x64.zip`, and copy the contained
`obs-plugins` and `data` directories into the OBS installation directory.
Close OBS before replacing plugin files, then restart it.

Open **Docks → Pitel Instant Replay — Instant Replay**. The unified dock starts on
the **Replay operator** tab; the legacy saved-MP4 bin remains available on the
second tab. Development artifacts are unsigned and require OBS Studio 31+.

## How to use

1. **Add the capture filter to each camera.** Right-click a camera source →
   *Filters* → add **Pitel Instant Replay Capture**. Set the buffer duration and
   quality there.
2. **Add the playback source.** In your replay scene, add a **Pitel Instant Replay**
   source and pick which camera to replay from in its properties. Set the
   playback speed and, under *When the replay ends*, choose *Return to the
   previous scene*. Optionally set intro/outro sponsor clips.
3. **Live replay.** Cut to the replay scene → the last N seconds play
   automatically, then it returns to your main camera.
4. **Replay bin.** Open the **Replays (Pitel Instant Replay)** dock. It lists your
   saved replays with thumbnails; double-click any of them to send it to
   program. The save folder is set with the ⚙ button (defaults to
   `Videos/Pitel Instant Replay`).

presets, reverse, play last saved replay).

## Building from source

Uses the standard [OBS plugin template](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-plugintemplate)
build system.

```sh
cmake --preset windows-x64
cmake --build --preset windows-x64
```

## Support development

Plugins like this take a lot of time, testing and late nights to build and keep
working across OBS updates. Pitel Instant Replay is free and open source, and it will
stay that way. If it has been useful for your broadcasts, a small contribution
helps me keep maintaining it, adding new features, and building more free tools
for the community. Every bit is genuinely appreciated — thank you for your
support! 🙏
